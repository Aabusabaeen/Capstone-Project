# Effect of COVID-19 on Saudi Trading
- This repository  includes my work for the final Capstone Project in the DSI course by MiSK.


## Why this topic: 
- COVID-19 has affected the whole world in terms of health, economy, and even businesses.
- Since I have some experience with my father's business in exporting, I have noticed the changes on the field and wanted to explore the effect of COVID-19 on the whole country.

## Main covered points:
- Saudi exports overview.
- changes on exports during COVID-19 (2020 & 2021).
- Top five exports in 2019, 2020, 2021.
- Saudi imports overview.
- Changes on imports during COVID-19 (2020 & 2021).
- Top five imports in 2019, 2020, 2021.
- Summary of changes during these years.

### Questions that I am answering using the data:

- How much did COVID-19 affect the Saudi imports & export?
- What are the main areas that got affected? 
- What are the changes on the Saudi exports & imports from 2011-2021?
- What does Saudi export the most?
- How much does the Saudi economy rely on oil?
- Are the non-oil exports increasing?
- What does Saudi import the most? 
- Is Saudi Arabia recovering from the effects of COVID-19?
