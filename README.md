This is the repository where I am adding all the files I am using in my Capstone Project


Capstone Project: 
- Topic: The size of the tradings in Saudi Arabia from 2018-2021 (before and during covid).

Why this topic: 
When Fatema Alamer was presenting her capstone project from the previous DSI course, she influnced me to find answers for:
1- How much did Saudi import & export from 2010 to 2020?
2- What does Saudi export the most? Such as dates, oil, used cars, used clothes, etc.
3- What does Saudi import the most? Such as new cars, new clothes, medicine, medical equipment (Masks during covid), etc.
4- What are the things that Saudi is planning to produce to lower their dependincy on importing? military equipment, electric cars, etc. 
5- How much has Saudi been importing & exporting in terms of specific materials, such as Petrochemicals, medicine, car parts, and vegetables? 

All of these questions, and even more, can be answered from these massive excel sheets I found online. 
I can even look up online how much Saudi is expecting to produce by 2030, and estimate how much money Saudi would spend inside the country rather than spending outside the country on importing.

Data source: https://www.stats.gov.sa/ar/325

The data I found is huge! and I am 100% sure that when I spend more time exploring this data, I will come up with even better questions to ask, analyze, and answer.
